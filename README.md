Code Test 
================================

## Test description & expectation

We have three endpoints

* https://5c3ce12c29429300143fe570.mockapi.io/api/registeredusers returns all the registered users in the system
* https://5c3ce12c29429300143fe570.mockapi.io/api/unregisteredusers returns all the unregistered users in the system
* https://5c3ce12c29429300143fe570.mockapi.io/api/projectmemberships returns all the project memberships for all users, registered and unregistered, in the system

Your task is to implement a new service with a single endpoint that will return all the users, registered and unregistered, including the project ids the users belong to.  If users do not belong to a project, project ids attribute would contain an empty array in the response payload. 

The service can be implemented in any language/platform that you are most comfortable with.  Having said that, we do have primary languages on our team so you would get mucho respect & bonus points if the solution is implemented in the following languages.
```
java
groovy
kotlin
node (es6+ | typescript)
```  

The endpoint must use http protocol.  The endpoint must return json by default.

Example of json payload to be returned from the new endpoint
```
[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "city": "Jaydashire",
    "company": "Goyette - Renner",
    "country": "South Africa",
    "firstName": "firstName 1",
    "lastName": "lastName 1",
    "organizationType": "organizationType 1",
    "phone": "524.276.1570 x487",
    "state": "SD",
    "zipCode": "68048",
    "disclaimerAccepted": false,
    "languageCode": "en",
    "emailAddress": "last1@mail.com",
    "projectIds": ["1","2"]
  },
  {  
    "id":"21",
    "emailAddress":"email1@somewhere.com",
    "languageCode":"en",
    "registrationId":"jwsMJNOk3oM3hVM5bGcF1",
    "registrationIdGeneratedTime":"156165026851",
    "projectIds": []
  }   
]
```  

The solution must include tests

Once you have complete the solution, please do the following

1. Fill in the [Test solution](#test-solution-a-namesolutiona) 
2. Push it as a public repo on github.com. 
3. Send us the link to your repo and we will take a look.  Thank you very much!
